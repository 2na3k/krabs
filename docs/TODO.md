# TODO
- [x] Web fetch tool (cuz I need a web fetch)
- [x] Refactor the TUI since that is only one gigantic file.
- [x] Retry policy
- [ ] Refactor the model provider screen, and mechanism of registering model from custom provider (not just hard-coded everything)
- [ ] Refactor the credential storage (I don't think that should be the case)
- [x] Sandbox environment (https://browser-use.com/posts/two-ways-to-sandbox-agents)
- [ ] Krabots on Telegram -> still thinking about the architecture
- [ ] Monet as thinking guideline
